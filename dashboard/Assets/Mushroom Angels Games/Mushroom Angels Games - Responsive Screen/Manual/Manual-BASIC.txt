You have 3 templates to use the script, it's very simple.
You can use the screen scale to make it responsive

1 - Update all the time, this is not recommended, it can consume a lot of fps.
2 - Refresh from seconds to seconds. Consumes less memory resources, but is not recommended yet.
3 - Update Only when player changes screen settings.is the most recommended, all the code will only be qualified when the player 
changes the settings and in the pauser menu, however it requires you to implement a settings menu

Use the example scene to understand how the code works.
